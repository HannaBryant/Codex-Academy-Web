# Codex-Academy-Web

This is a project creating a website for Codex Academy.
This project is a three-page, responsive website for Codex Academy designed to inform students or anyone visiting, collect course inquiries, or just allow anyone to find information about Codex.
 The site includes a Home page that introduces Codex Academy, a Courses page that displays available courses with their duration and short descriptions, and a Contact page where users can submit inquiries through a form.
  The Contact form securely sends user data to a Supabase database, providing Codex Academy with an organized way to manage incoming inquiries while giving users immediate feedback upon submission.
  Also included in this project, is a codex academy chatbot. It's role giving users quick, but simple feedback about codex academy depending on what the user is asking. The Codex Academy assistant was originally implemented as a Node.js terminal chatbot using Cloudflare AI. For this project, I adapted the assistant to a frontend-only version for security reasons, preserving its behavior rules and scope while making it accessible through a floating chat widget.
